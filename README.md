## Overview

The **Invoice CRUD System** is a robust and efficient web application built using **Django** and **SQLite3**, designed to manage invoices seamlessly. This project allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete invoices while ensuring reliability, data integrity, and comprehensive error handling. It is an essential backend solution for businesses and developers looking for a scalable and maintainable invoice management system.

## Key Features

- **Invoice Creation**: Create new invoices with all necessary details such as invoice number, customer name, itemized breakdown, and total amount.
  
- **Retrieve Invoices**: Fetch stored invoices by their unique identifiers. If an invoice is not present or has been deleted, the system responds with a clear and user-friendly message indicating that the invoice does not exist, ensuring transparency and usability.

- **Update/Delete Invoices**: Easily update or remove invoices as needed, allowing for real-time management and dynamic control over the records.

- **Data Integrity & Error Handling**: The application ensures proper error handling for edge cases, such as attempts to retrieve missing, deleted, or non-existent invoices. This guarantees smooth performance and user clarity when handling invoice data.

- **Metadata Handling**: In addition to standard invoice operations, the system effectively manages metadata associated with each invoice, ensuring complete and accurate information retrieval and storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite3
- **Front-end**: Django Templating Engine (HTML/CSS)
